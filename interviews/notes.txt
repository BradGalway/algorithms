int * const a; - cannot change value of a but can change pointer
const int * a; - can chance value but not pointer
static member variables - only defined once (all objects have the same value for this member). You
can even access it without instantiating an object. The same thing goes for static methods.
static variables - someone from outside the file can use it
static functions - only functions within the file can use it

Dynamic programming:

- Generally you have a starting state (or more than one) and you make decisions
  based on calculations of passed states.
- For the least coin problem, the states are all possible values of the combination of coins
